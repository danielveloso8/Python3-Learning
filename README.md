## How to Set Up
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/danielveloso8/Python3-Learning.git`
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install Jupyter for notebook projects: `pip install jupyter` (if needed).
4. Navigate to project folders and run scripts or notebooks as indicated.

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastered control flow, lists, loops, functions, and string manipulation.
- Applied concepts to real-world scenarios like sales analysis, decoding, and physics calculations.
- Developed GitHub-ready projects with documentation.

## Future Plans
- Expand projects with advanced data structures (e.g., dictionaries).
- Integrate data visualization using Matplotlib.
- Contribute to open-source data projects.

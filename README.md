# Python3-Learning
This repository showcases my Python 3 projects developed during the Codecademy Python 3 course and revisited as part of my Data Analyst with AI Bootcamp, starting September 1, 2025.

## Projects
- **projects/magic8ball/magic8ball.py**: A Magic 8-Ball simulator utilizing if/elif/else statements and random number generation. This project demonstrates foundational skills in conditional logic and string manipulation, applicable to data filtering and decision-making in data analysis.  
  - **Status**: Completed  
  - **Date**: September 2025

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder (e.g., `cd projects/magic8ball`).
3. Run: `python magic8ball.py` in the terminal.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with conditional statements, random functions, and project organization.
- Established a foundation for data analysis tasks, including logic-based data processing.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance `magic8ball.py` with loops for multiple questions and dataset integration.
- Add detailed documentation and visualizations for upcoming projects.
- Expand with advanced data analysis techniques from the bootcamp.

## Technologies
- **Python 3**: Core programming language used in this repository.

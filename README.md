# Magic 8-Ball Simulator
This is my initial project from the Python 3 course on Codecademy, revisited on September 1, 2025. It simulates a Magic 8-Ball, providing random answers to questions using basic control flow.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Run in terminal: `python magic8ball.py`.

## Features
- Generates a random number (1-9) to select an answer.
- Supports a name and question input.
- Includes basic error checking for empty questions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced `if/elif/else` statements.
- Used `random.randint` for randomness.
- Applied string manipulation with `.strip()`.

## Future Improvements
- Add more answer options.
- Enhance with loops for multiple questions.
